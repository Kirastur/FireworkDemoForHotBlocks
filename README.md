# FireworkDemoForHotBlocks
This is a demo to demonstrate you how to use a custom Modification object to generate a firework when a HotBlock gets removed in HotBlocks.

Install the HotBlocks plugin from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hotblocks-mechanic.93691

This demo requires the two demo rules from the out-of-the-box HotBlocks config.yml

To watch the demo, do the following :
1. Enter the server with your player
2. Enter "/hotblocks enable world" to enable HotBlocks for the normal world
3. Place a "Blue Concrete" Block on the ground
4. Jump on top of this block. As a result the blue block must change its color to red.
5. After one second the red block gets removed. You see a firework at this place.

Note: Since we use the default firework settings, the firework is very small, it looks more like a bit smoke than a real firework.
