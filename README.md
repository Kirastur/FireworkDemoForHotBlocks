# FireworkDemoForHotBlocks
This is a demo to demonstrate you how to use a custom Modification object to generate a firework when a HotBlock gets removed in HotBlocks.

Install the HotBlocks plugin from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hotblocks-mechanic.93691

This demo requires the two demo rules from the out-of-the-box HotBlocks plugin.yml

To watch the demo, do the following (this example is based on "The New Economy" as Economy system):

Install "Vault" and "The New Economy"
Login to the server and query your balance ("/tne balance ")
Enter "/hotblocks enable world" to enable Hotblocks for the normal world
Place a "Blue Concrete" Block on the ground
Jump on top of this block. As a result the blue block must change its color to red.
Query your balance again ("/tne balance "). You should have one dollar more.
